# BookmarkStats
A python application to get statistics from a browser bookmark export

# Features
* Counts all bookmarks in a (Chrome only) bookmark HTML export
* Counts all bookmarks in folders and sub-folders
* Calculates percentage of bookmarks in each folder/sub-folder
* Visually nests (tabs) sub-folders

# TODO
* Add sorting options (based on count, etc.)
* Add support for multiple browsers
* Add duplicate checking (same ignoring protocol, same ignoring querystring, almost the same)
* Add timeout checking (HEAD request)
